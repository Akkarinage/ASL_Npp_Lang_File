1. What is this?
---------
This file is capable of highlighting the functions when you're using Notepad++ to edit your NPC files. Syntax highlighting helps users in a variety of ways.


2. Prerequisites
---------
Notepad++ 6.3.2 or higher


3. Installation
---------
To install this file, you simply need to drop it into the correct location.

On a Windows 7 system, you should have a folder structure similar to this:
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\

This is the location for the userDefineLang.xml - all you need to do is paste it in there.

Load up N++ and open an NPC file. Click on the Language menu at the top of the application, then select *ASL at the bottom of the list.
Your script should now be colour-coded.
